        <h1>WELCOME TO DUNGEON MAINTENANCE</h1>
        <h2>A place for all your mainstream and misfit Dungeons and Dragons characters to grow, flourish, and mingle!
            Finally, one convenient location to store all of your character ideas! From your curious and brave Elven
            Rangers seeking out knowledge and adventure in the farthest reaches of the land to your Tiefling Sorcerer
            head cheerleader bent on destroying the Lich that killed her prom date, all are welcome here. </h2>
        <h2>Head over to our <a href="/api/character">Community Characters</a> tab where you will be able to see all of
            the
            characters in the Dungeon at this time. Add your own in the Build Your Character form and come back
            later to
            see which other poor souls have been trapped with your creations. Soon, you will be able to view and
            edit
            your own characters and get inspired via the randomized name and description feature as well. Now, go
            forth
            and may the dice be in your favor! </h2>
